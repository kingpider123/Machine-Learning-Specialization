# PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS
PCA is introduced as a method to:

* Reduce high-dimensional data (e.g. 50 or 1,000 features) to just 2 or 3 dimensions.

* Enable visualization of complex datasets on 2D or 3D plots.

* Help uncover patterns or anomalies in the data by projecting it onto new axes that capture the most variance.

Choose axis that would capture the as much info as possible
